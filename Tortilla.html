	<p> The Tortilla is the base of the burritto, if your tortilla is bad, the whole burritto is messed up. For a good base, you need your tortilla to not be too thick, or too dry. If your burritto is too thick, you will just be getting a mouthful of bread. Nobody wants that. If you burritto is too dry it will be too hard to bite into, and you won't even be able to enjoy your burritto. To have a perfect tortilla, it has to be soft, and just moist enough that it is not hurting your teeth, but not wet. </p>
