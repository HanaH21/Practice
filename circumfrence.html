	<p> Circumfrence is very important. The burritto can't be too big or too small. If it is too small, it doesn't even qualify as a meal, and you feel like you wasted you money. If it is too big, you can't pick it up with your hands, and it becomes something that you have to eat with a knife and fork. Burrittos should NEVER be eaten with a knife and fork. </p>
